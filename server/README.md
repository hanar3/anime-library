### Requirements

Before you start, you'll need the following tools installed:
[Git](https://git-scm.com),
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/),
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).


P.S.: You'll also need [MAKE](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) if you happen to be on Windows.

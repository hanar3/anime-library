### About

The anime library is a website that helps you keep track of your animes - mark an anime as watched, watching or dropped, create a library and share with your friends. 

This is a pet project where I toy around with technologies and new concepts I learn. As of now, I'm getting familiar with GraphQL and applying some of the principles of SOLID pattern.
